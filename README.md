# Machine-Code-Disassmbler

This will attempt to dissamble machine code and output it into readable strings.

You will have to give a path to the the txt file that has the machine code in it without quotes.

Depending if you did it right it should output into a txt file.

This project is still in the works so it might also not work half the time. 

Give it a shot and enjoy.
